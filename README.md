# Serverless Tool Comparison

This repo shows how to implement a simple route counter using API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Dynamo DB. The same example is implemented in the following frameworks. The readme for each example describes how to install the tool and deploy to AWS.

- [Serverless Framework](./serverless)
- [Terraform](./terraform)
- [Claudia](./claudia)
- [Up](./up)
- [Pulumi](./pulumi)

This is a companion to the Velocity San Jose talk, [Tooling in the age of serverless computing](https://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/vl-ca/public/schedule/detail/67950).
